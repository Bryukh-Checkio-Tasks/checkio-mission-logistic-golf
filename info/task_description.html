    For parcel delivery is important to find the shortest path.
    Let's look at simple model of road map, where roads are straight lines between cities.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a road map as a graph in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix">
    distance matrix</a> representation. For <strong>N</strong> cities the matrix has NxN size.
    The matrix (two-dimensional array) containing the distances, taken pairwise, of a set of points.
    For example an element in i-th row and j-th column show a distance between city i and j.
    If matrix[i][j]&nbsp;==&nbsp;0, then a road doesn't exist between these cities.
    The roads are undirected, so matrix[i][j]&nbsp;==&nbsp;matrix[j][i].
    And the matrix has zero main diagonal.
</p>
<p>
    You should find the shortest path between <strong>0th</strong> and <strong>(N-1)th</strong>
    cities.
    The result must be a total length of this path. If the path doesn't exist then return 0.
</p>
<p>
    For example this map will be represented with the follow matrix and the result is 116.

<div>

    <p style="float: left">

    <pre>
(( 0, 80, 58,  0),
 (80,  0, 71, 80),
 (58, 71,  0, 58),
 ( 0, 80, 58,  0))
</pre>

    <strong>Additional rules: </strong>
    This is a <strong>code golf mission</strong> and your main goal is to make your code as short as possible.
    The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    250 characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 250, you earn 1 point. For example for 200 character long code earns you 50 points.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A road map as a tuple of tuples with integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The length of the shortest path from city 0 to city (N-1) as an integer.
