    For parcel delivery, it is important to find the shortest path.
    Let's look at simple model of road map, where roads are straight lines between cities.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a road map as a graph in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix">
    distance matrix</a> representation.
    For <strong>N</strong> cities, the matrix has a size of NxN. The matrix (a two-dimensional array)
    contains the
    distances as of sets of points. For example: an element in i-th row and j-th column shows a
    distance between city i and j. If the matrix[i][j]&nbsp;==&nbsp;0, then a road doesn't exist between these
    cities. The roads are undirected, so matrix[i][j]&nbsp;==&nbsp;matrix[j][i], and in addition, the matrix
    has zero main diagonal.
</p>
<p>
    You should find the shortest path between the <strong>0th</strong> and <strong>(N-1)th</strong>
    cities. The result must be the
    total length of this path. If a path doesn't exist then return 0.
</p>
<p>
    For example: this map will is represented by the following matrix and results in 116.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

    <p style="display: inline-block">
        <img title="simple-graph" src="{{MEDIA}}simple-graph.svg" alt="simple-graph" width="200px"/>
    </p>
    <pre style="display: inline-block">
(( 0, 80, 58,  0),
 (80,  0, 71, 80),
 (58, 71,  0, 58),
 ( 0, 80, 58,  0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Additional rules: </strong>
    This is a <strong>code golf mission</strong> and your main goal is to make your code as short as
    possible.
    The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    350 characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 350, you earn 1 point. For example for 200 character long code
    earns you 150 points.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A road map as a tuple of tuples with integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The length of the shortest path from city 0 to city (N-1) as an
    integer.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
golf(((0, 80, 58, 0), (80, 0, 71, 80), (58, 71, 0, 58), (0, 80, 58, 0))) == 116</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a classic pathfinding problem, but in this situation you need to lean more on your
    creativity and python tricks. It can help to illustrate some of the more in-depth comprehensions
    of Pythonâ€™s mechanisms.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    1 &lt; len(matrix) &le; 20<br>
    all(len(matrix[0]) == len(row) for row in matrix)<br>
    all(not matrix[i][i] for i in range(len(matrix)))<br>
    all(all(matrix[i][j] == matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))) for i in range(len(matrix)))<br>
    all(all(0 &le; el &lt; 10 ** 5 for el in row) for row in matrix)<br>
